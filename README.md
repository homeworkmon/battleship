The Odin Project Test Driven Development project!

Goal was to learn how to use Jest to implement tests while building. I did struggle with keeping tests relevant while code evolved and methods/functions became private in scope.

Overall testing is interesting and much more useful than console.logging everything!

My code could definitely be cleaner and the AI player could be smarter but this was a good excercise in learning nonetheless. 

Project is written entirely in vanilla JS! ðŸ˜© 

### What I learned:
1. Muuuuch more practice with more complex JS modules, objects and event listeners
2. Using Jest to write tests and running them
3. First time using object mixins to copy methods
4. Used eslint and learned a lot from its suggestions!
